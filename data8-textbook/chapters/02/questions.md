# Multiple Choice Questions: Data Science Chapter 2

What is an observational study?

- A study where scientists make conclusions based on data they observed but did not generate *(correct)*
- A study where scientists run experiments on individuals
- A study that only uses computer simulations
- A study that only uses surveys

---

What is the main difference between an association and a causal association?

- A causal association means the treatment causes the outcome *(correct)*
- An association always means causation
- There is no difference
- Association is only about correlation

---

What was the leading theory for the spread of cholera before John Snow's work?

- Miasmas (bad smells) caused disease *(correct)*
- Germs caused disease
- Water was always clean
- Air pollution was the only cause

---

What did John Snow use to help identify the source of the cholera outbreak?

- A map showing the locations of deaths and water pumps *(correct)*
- A computer simulation
- A survey of local businesses
- A weather report

---

What was the key difference between the Lambeth and S&V water companies in Snow's analysis?

- The source of their water supply *(correct)*
- The number of employees
- The price of water
- The size of their delivery area

---

What is a treatment group in an experiment?

- The group that receives the treatment being studied *(correct)*
- The group that is ignored
- The group that receives a placebo
- The group that is not measured

---

What is a control group?

- The group that does not receive the treatment *(correct)*
- The group that receives extra treatment
- The group that is always larger
- The group that is not observed

---

What is a confounding factor?

- An underlying difference between groups other than the treatment *(correct)*
- The main variable being tested
- The outcome of the experiment
- The method of randomization

---

Why is randomization important in experiments?

- It helps ensure treatment and control groups are similar apart from the treatment *(correct)*
- It makes experiments faster
- It guarantees perfect results
- It is only used in medical studies

---

What is a randomized controlled trial (RCT)?

- An experiment where individuals are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups *(correct)*
- An observational study
- A survey-based study
- A computer simulation

---

What is a placebo?

- Something that looks like the treatment but has no effect *(correct)*
- The main treatment
- The outcome variable
- The confounding factor

---

What is a blind experiment?

- An experiment where individuals do not know which group they are in *(correct)*
- An experiment with no control group
- An experiment with no data
- An experiment with only one group

---

What is a natural experiment?

- A study where groups are divided by circumstances outside the researcher's control *(correct)*
- An experiment done in nature
- A study with no randomization
- A study with only animals

---

What is the main lesson about confounding from the coffee and lung cancer example?

- Confounding factors can make it difficult to determine causality *(correct)*
- Coffee causes lung cancer
- Smoking is not a confounding factor
- Confounding is never a problem

---

What is the main limitation of observational studies for establishing causality?

- Confounding factors may exist *(correct)*
- They are always more expensive
- They use too much data
- They prevent the use of statistical tests

---

What is a key feature of a good control group?

- It is similar to the treatment group in all ways except the treatment *(correct)*
- It is always larger than the treatment group
- It receives a placebo
- It is not measured

---

What is the main advice for establishing causality in studies?

- Run a randomized controlled experiment if possible *(correct)*
- Only use observational studies
- Avoid using control groups
- Never use randomization
