# Modeling to predict the future

Our prior course focused on visualizations as a means to understand. This course builds on that concept, but mainly focuses on creating models. A model is a simplified version of the real-world, expressed in mathematical terms.

We have several key challenges:

- Simplicity: we want models that are concise with the fewest possible fields
- Measurement: all measurement is flawed, but we need to capture the right amount of detail
- Error: all models are limited, so we need standard ways of capturing error.

## Our process

### Explore the dataset

- Learn about a dataset
  - Variables (or predictors, features, or independent variables)
  - Target (or outcome or dependent variable)
- Understand
  - Each variable's distribution
  - Relationships between variables

### Create a prediction model

- Prepare the data
  - Fix data problems to make it work better with our algorithm
  - Split the data into training & test
- Create a model
  - Pick an appropriate model algorithm
  - Train a model on the training data

### Make judgements about the model with inference

- Measure the accuracy of the model on training data
  - Numerical or categorical (false positive, true negative, ...)
- Measure the accuracy of the model on testing data

### Communicate results

- Charts
- Written / presentation
- Mathematical formulas
